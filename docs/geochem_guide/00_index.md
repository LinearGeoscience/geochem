# Geochemical Analysis Guide

## Introduction
This guide provides a comprehensive resource for geochemical analysis in economic geology. It is designed for geologists and data scientists who need to rigorously analyze geochemical data for exploration and research.

The guide is divided into two main sections:

1.  **[Principles of Analysis](./01_principles_of_analysis.md)**: Covers the fundamental concepts of geochemical data handling, including QA/QC, statistical analysis, data normalization, and element mobility. It emphasizes robust statistical methods for handling compositional data and censored values.
2.  **[Deposit Type Guides](./02_deposit_types.md)**: Provides detailed geochemical signatures, pathfinder elements, alteration zonation, and fertility indices for major economic deposit types, including:
    *   Porphyry Cu-Au-Mo
    *   Epithermal (High & Low Sulphidation)
    *   VMS (Volcanogenic Massive Sulphide)
    *   Orogenic Gold
    *   Magmatic Ni-Cu-PGE (Komatiite & Intrusion-hosted)
    *   Carbonatites (REE-Nb-Ta)
    *   Unconformity-related Uranium

## How to Use This Guide
- Start with the **Principles** section to ensure your data is clean, levelled, and statistically valid.
- Refer to the specific **Deposit Type** sections for targeted exploration vectors and interpretation of geochemical anomalies.
